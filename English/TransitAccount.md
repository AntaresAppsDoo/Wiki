# Antares Apps doo â€“ Transit Account

# Description of functionality
A transit account can be used in purchasing to temporarily post document lines to the general ledger to the selected transit account instead of the purchasing account. A transit account can be entered on purchase order lines, purchase invoice lines, and purchase credit memo lines.

## Entry of the transitional account on the purchase document
In order for the entry of the transitional account on the purchase document to be possible, it is necessary to display the field "Transit G/L Account No." in the purchase document. If the value of the field was entered during posting, the purchase account will be replaced by the entered account. If the value of the field is ignored, the posting takes place on the purchase account.
